## Chain Reaction

Chain Reaction is a strategic board game that combines elements of planning, spatial reasoning, and chain reactions. The game typically consists of the following components:

Game Board: The game board is a grid with multiple cells. Each cell can hold from one to three sphere.

Objective: The goal is to capturing your opponent's spheres and be the last on the grid!

Gameplay: Players take turns placing one of their spheres on an empty cell of the game board.
When a sphere is placed on the board, it may interact with neighboring cells. The interactions can cause spheres to move, replicate, or be captured.
The key to success in Chain Reaction is to plan your moves strategically to trigger chain reactions that advance your objective while thwarting your opponent's progress.
Players must carefully consider the consequences of their actions and anticipate how their sphere placements will affect the board.
Winning: The game can have various win conditions, such as capturing all of your opponent's spheres, reaching a specific score first, or achieving a particular game objective.

Chain Reaction is a game that requires critical thinking, adaptability, and a good understanding of the game's mechanics. It can be played as a two-player game or with more players, depending on the version and rules in use. The gameplay can be both challenging and entertaining, making it a popular choice among strategy game enthusiasts.
